# Using Python Selenium Unittest to automate test in SauceDemo

## Purpose
I do not own SauceDemo. Website is owned by Sauce Labs. I am only using the website to practice and apply my knowledge on automation tools/frameworks.

## Notes
To use the scripts, please do the following:
- Have Python installed in your OS and download Selenium
- Download the latest Chrome Driver in here: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/. Then place it in the root folder.
